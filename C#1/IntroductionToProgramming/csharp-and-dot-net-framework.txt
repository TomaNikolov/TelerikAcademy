Difference between C# and .NET Framework

 .NET Framework (pronounced dot net) is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known as the Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for the .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. The FCL and the CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.
 C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
